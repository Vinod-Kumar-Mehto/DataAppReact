For this project i have used functional-based components in which i used usestate hooks. When the user clicks on the getUser button, then data will get fetched and save the data in state. After that, the map function will map the data and render it on the web. In between, the time gap for data fetching the loader appears.

Time taken to make this project is 4 hours.
